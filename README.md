## Tab Navigation
This project is a simple and visually appealing tab navigation interface designed to mimic a mobile phone layout. It features a series of tabs, each associated with an icon and an image, representing different sections of a website or application. The sections include Home, Work, Blog, and About Us. The interface leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a smooth and responsive user experience.
